## yolk

Yolk is nest.land's official API client library for Deno.

## Usage 

### Deno

```typescript
import * as yolk from "https://x.nest.land/yolk@0.2.0-rc2/mod.ts";
```

### Web

```sh
yarn add @nestdotland/yolk
# or
npm i @nestdotland/yolk
```

```typescript
import * as yolk from "@nestdotland/yolk";
```

## What is nest.land?

Nest.land combines Deno with the [Arweave Blockchain](https://www.arweave.org/). With us, you can publish your Deno modules to the permaweb, where they can never be deleted. This avoids a major pitfall for web-based module imports while allowing the developer to maximize on the potential of Deno's import design!
